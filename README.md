Communicate with a socket.io server through PocketMine-MP server.<br>

### Usage

Modify `Main.php` file with the websocket server ip and add whatever you'd like<br>
Run the server.<br>
* You must have a working websocket server up and running for it to work.
* If the websocket server is down, it won't work

## Important
The websocket server must be socket.io (real-time application framework based on Node.js) or else it won't work.
